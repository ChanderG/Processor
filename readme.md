#Processor

###What?
A 32 bit MIPS like RISC processor designed in Verilog.

I will soon post links to the exact specification and the ISA we created.

###Helpful Instructions

1.We used Altium Designer and Aldec Simulator. The Simulator does not reflect changes in the code base when "reset". The only safe way to work with it is to "end" the session and start over.
